## 1. Best practices

### 1.1 Explain consequences

Clearly describe the result of a user action so they can make informed decisions.

- **Do**: State what happens after the action and explain how to undo it
- **Don't**: Misrepresent consequences or use alarming, intimidating, or condescending language

Examples:

- **Do**: "Delete this photo? You can restore it from the trash within 30 days"
- **Don't**: "WARNING: This action is permanent and cannot be reversed!"

### 1.2 Use scannable words and formats

Help users quickly find relevant information by structuring content clearly.

- **Do**: Use clear titles and headings to organize and group related content
- **Don't**: Use vague or generic headings

Examples:

- **Do**: "Payment methods" (as a section heading)
- **Don't**: "Information" (as a section heading)

### 1.3 Use sentence case

Capitalize only the first word in a sentence or phrase. Applies to all text: titles, headings, labels, menus, navigation, app bars, buttons.

- **Do**: Capitalize the first word only
- **Don't**: Use title case (except for proper nouns or brand names)

Examples:

- **Do**: "Search settings"
- **Don't**: "Search Settings"

### 1.4 Use abbreviations sparingly

Spell out words when possible. Use abbreviations only when space is limited and the abbreviation is widely understood.

- **Do**: Spell out fully: "for example", "and so on"
- **Don't**: Use Latin abbreviations: "e.g.", "etc."

Examples:

- **Do**: "3 messages, including 1 draft"
- **Don't**: "3 msgs, incl. 1 dft"

## 2. Word choice

### 2.1 Use second-person pronouns ("you", "your")

Address the user directly to make the UI feel personal and action-oriented.

- **Do**: Write from the user's point of view using "you" and "your"
- **Don't**: Use impersonal or robotic phrasing

Examples:

- **Do**: "Your order has been confirmed"
- **Don't**: "The order has been confirmed"

### 2.2 Don't mix first and second person

Maintain a consistent perspective within the same context.

- **Do**: Pick one perspective and use it consistently
- **Don't**: Combine "me/my" with "you/your" in the same phrase or screen

Examples:

- **Do**: "Change your preferences" (consistent second person)
- **Don't**: "Change my preferences in your account" (mixed)

### 2.3 Use caution with "I" and "we"

Reserve first person for specific contexts only.

- **Do**: Use "I" only in legal or ownership contexts (e.g., "I agree to the Terms of Service")
- **Don't**: Use "I" or "we" to speak on behalf of the organization
- **Caution**: "We/our" can feel impersonal even when representing real people

Examples:

- **Do**: "I agree to the Terms of Service" (legal consent)
- **Don't**: "We've updated your settings" — prefer "Your settings have been updated"

## 3. Grammar and punctuation

### 3.1 Skip periods for single-sentence UI text

Omit periods in short, standalone UI text elements.

- **Do**: Omit periods in labels, tooltips, bullet points, dialog body text, links
- **Do**: Use periods when text contains multiple sentences or complex content

Examples:

- **Do**: "No items in your cart" (single sentence, no period)
- **Don't**: "No items in your cart." (unnecessary period)

### 3.2 Use contractions

Write naturally using contractions for a conversational tone.

- **Do**: "Don't have an account?" instead of "Do not have an account?"
- **Caution**: Use full forms when emphasis is needed (e.g., "Do not share your password")

Examples:

- **Do**: "You can't undo this action"
- **Don't**: "You cannot undo this action" (unless emphasis is intended)

### 3.3 Use serial commas

Use the Oxford comma in lists of three or more items.

- **Do**: "Folders, files, and images"
- **Don't**: Use a serial comma before an ampersand: "Folders, files, & images"

### 3.4 Commas in numbers

Use commas as thousands separators for readability.

- **Do**: Use commas for numbers 1,000–999,999
- **Don't**: Use commas in years (2024), addresses, or frequencies
- **Tip**: For numbers over 1 million, abbreviate (e.g., "23M")

Examples:

- **Do**: "1,234 results"
- **Don't**: "1234 results"

### 3.5 Skip colons in headings

Avoid colons at the end of headings that introduce lists.

- **Do**: Omit colons in standalone list headings
- **Do**: Use colons for inline lists within body text

Examples:

- **Do**: "Supported formats" (heading, no colon)
- **Don't**: "Supported formats:" (heading with unnecessary colon)

### 3.6 Use exclamation points sparingly

Reserve exclamation points for genuinely celebratory or greeting moments.

- **Do**: "Welcome!" or "Congratulations, you've completed the course!"
- **Don't**: "Your file has been saved!" (routine action, no exclamation needed)

### 3.7 Use ellipses sparingly

Use ellipses only to indicate an action in progress or truncated text.

- **Do**: "Downloading..." (action in progress)
- **Don't**: "Save..." (in a button or menu item)
- **Tip**: No space before ellipses

### 3.8 Use parentheses to define terms

Use parentheses to clarify acronyms, jargon, or reference sources.

- **Do**: "SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protects your data"
- **Don't**: "Save your work (just in case)" (side note in parentheses)

### 3.9 Skip ampersands in body text

Reserve ampersands for space-constrained UI elements.

- **Do**: Use "&" in headlines, headers, buttons when space is limited
- **Don't**: Use "&" in email subject lines or regular prose

Examples:

- **Do**: "Terms and conditions" (body text)
- **Don't**: "Terms & conditions" (in body text)

### 3.10 Use dashes with caution

Avoid em dashes in UI text. Prefer simpler punctuation.

- **Avoid**: Em dashes — use commas, periods, or new sentences instead
- **Do**: Use en dash without spaces for ranges (e.g., "9 AM–Noon")

### 3.11 Use hyphens with care

Use hyphens to link closely related words or for negative numbers.

- **Do**: "Two-factor authentication", "-100"
- **Don't**: Surround hyphens with spaces

### 3.12 Use italics sparingly

Limit italics to emphasizing a single word or phrase, such as a title.

- **Do**: Emphasize a key word: "Only *you* can see this"
- **Don't**: Italicize entire sentences
- **Tip**: Prefer bold for emphasis in UI text

### 3.13 Don't use caps blocks

Avoid all-uppercase text for accessibility and readability.

- **Do**: Use sentence case: "Learn more"
- **Don't**: Use all caps: "LEARN MORE"
